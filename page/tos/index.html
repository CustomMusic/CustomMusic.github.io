<ol>
<li><p><b>Modification.</b>  Sometimes changes in the law or changes in the relationships between Crucial and our content providers (including but not limited to artists, song writers, record labels, music publishers, and other third-party rights holders) will require us to modify this Agreement, which we may do from time to time. The most up-to-date version of the amended Agreement can always be found at <a href="index.html">https://www.crucialcustom.com/page/tos</a>.

<li><b>Eligibility to Use the Service.</b>

  <ol type="a">

    <li><p> In order to use the Crucial Service, you must be at least 18 years of age and a resident of a country in which Crucial is legally authorized to operate the Crucial Service.

In addition, in order to gain access to any downloadable Tracks from the Custom portion of the Crucial Service and/or high-resolution files from the pre-cleared Tracks, you must also provide your physical address and billing information, including valid credit card information.

You may not post, transmit, or share User Content on the Site that you did not create or that you do not have permission to post and by posting, transmitting, or sharing such User Content, you represent and warrant that you have all rights thereto.  You understand and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, review the Site and may delete or remove (without notice) any Site Content or User Content in our sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, including without limitation User Content that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement, or which might be offensive, illegal, or that might violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of users or others.  You are solely responsible at your sole cost and expense for creating backup copies and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Site or provide to us. In addition, you understand and agree that your content may be available for download either by links provided by yourself, or by third party plugins solely for the purpose of facilitating the work of artist, composer, producer, or any other person ("Creative Contributors") and is subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement signed between Crucial and Creative Contributors. You may specifically uncheck the default setting of download capability of any content you have uploaded to our servers and/or private Vimeo channel, so that your content will not be available for download directly from Crucial. However, you acknowledge that third party plugins exist providing downloading capability of any content of which Crucial has no control over, and for which Crucial will not be responsible for, and Creative Contributors may utilize such plugins to facilitate the work subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Copyright Infringement.</b>  If we receive proper written notification of alleged copyright infringement, we will promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and terminate the accounts of repeat infringers as described herein in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).  If you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you may send a written notification of such infringement to <a href="mailto:info@crucialcustom.com">info@crucialcustom.com</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Repeat Infringer. </b> In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, members who are deemed to be repeat infringers.

<li><b>Rights Granted.</b>

  <ol type="a">

    <li><p> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Crucial grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and stream Tracks (and, subject to the registration requirements set forth in Section 3, download low resolution mp3 files containing Tracks) via the Crucial Service in legally authorized jurisdictions solely for evaluation purposes, and to otherwise use the Crucial Service made available for free through the Site. No other right or interest is granted in or to the Crucial Service or any Tracks.  Crucial reserves all right, title and interest not expressly granted under this license to the fullest extent possible under applicable laws.  ANY USE OF THE CRUCIAL SERVICE NOT SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.</p></li>

    <li>Except as expressly permitted above, unless and until you execute a separate license and/or assignment specifically related to the Track(s) concerned and until you pay the fees associated therewith, you expressly agree that you shall not be permitted to download, reproduce, or use in any way the Tracks or other copyrighted material accessible via the Crucial Service and/or Site.  Additionally, you agree that you will not:

      <ol type="i">

        <li><p>copy, store, edit, change, prepare any derivative work of, or alter in any way any of the Tracks available through the Crucial Service;</p></li>

        <li><p>make the Crucial Service available over a network (other than Crucial’s network) where it could be used by others;</p></li>

        <li><p>translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify or create derivative works based on the Crucial Service, a Crucial application, or any portion thereof except as expressly allowed under applicable law;</p></li>

        <li><p>circumvent any technology used by Crucial or its licensors to protect content accessible via the Crucial Service;</p></li>

        <li><p>rent, lease or sublicense any of the Crucial Service;</p></li>

        <li><p>use the Crucial Service in any way that violates the terms of this Agreement.</p></li>

      </ol>
    </li>

    <li><p> You shall not attempt to contact, hire, or engage directly any Creative Contributors contributing to the creation of Tracks and/or providing creative services through the Crucial Service, nor shall you solicit such Creative Contributors to contact you by any means other than the closed chat system available through the Crucial Service or otherwise engage such Creative Contributors for any services similar to or competitive with those offered through the Crucial Service.  You acknowledge and agree that doing so will cause irreparable harm to Crucial.  Without limiting Crucial’s other rights or remedies and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a violation of this paragraph, Crucial shall be entitled to (and you agree to pay) a fee equal to that which Crucial would have received if you and the Creative Contributor had used the Crucial Service.</p></li>

  </ol>

</li>

<li><p><b>Changes to Crucial Service.</b>  From time to time, Crucial may make changes or updates to the Crucial Service, either at no cost or subject to additional fees, in Crucial’s sole discretion.

WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, CRUCIAL MAY MODIFY, SUSPEND, OR DISCONTINUE THE CRUCIAL SERVICE (INCLUDING ANY CONTENT) OR YOUR USE OF THEM. WHENEVER CRUCIAL ELECTS TO MODIFY, SUSPEND, OR DISCONTINUE THE CRUCIAL SERVICE, IT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY.</p></li>

    <li><p> SOME OF THE CONTENT, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CRUCIAL SERVICE MAY INCLUDE MATERIALS THAT BELONG TO THIRD PARTIES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CRUCIAL ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH CONTENT, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.</p></li>

  </ol>
</li>

<li><b>Limitations of Liability.</b>  EXCEPT FOR ANY APPLICABLE LIABILITIES OR REMEDIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER LOCAL APPLICABLE LAWS:

  <ol type="a">

    <li><p> IN NO EVENT WILL CRUCIAL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR INDIRECT, GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, CORRUPTION OF FILES, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) EVEN IF CRUCIAL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY CRUCIAL OR OTHERS WILL CREATE A WARRANTY AND NEITHER YOU NOR ANY THIRD PARTY MAY RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY OR MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p></li>

    <li><p> CRUCIAL’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF TEN U.S. DOLLARS (US $10.00) OR THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE CRUCIAL SERVICE AT ISSUE WITHIN THE PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR.</p></li>
  </ol>

</li>

<li><p><b>Indemnification.</b>  You will indemnify and hold Crucial, its directors, officers, employees, agents and licensors harmless with respect to any suits or claims arising out of your breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to, any infringement by you of the intellectual property of any third party, or any third party claims arising out of your use or misuse of the Crucial Service.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Governing Law.</b>  By visiting or using the Site, you agree that the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us or any of our affiliates.  With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as set forth below), you agree to not commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts located in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee.</p></li>

<li><b>Dispute Resolution.</b>

  <ol type="a">

    <li><p> For any dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief or any claim or dispute related to the enforcement or validity or either party’s intellectual property rights) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the parties shall resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The parties shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction; and (iv) the decision of the arbitrator will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general legal action</p></li>

    <li><p> In the event of a dispute, you or Crucial must give the other a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any notice of dispute by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested) or overnight courier providing delivery confirmation to Crucial Music, 12031 Ventura Blvd. Ste. 2, Studio City, CA 91604, with a courtesy copy to Keller Turner Ruth Andrews Ghanem &amp; Heller, PLLC, 700 12th Avenue South, Suite 302, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, Attn: Jason L. Turner.</p></li>

    <li><p> Crucial will send any notice of dispute to you by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested) or overnight courier providing delivery confirmation to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. The parties will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, either you or Crucial may commence arbitration.</p></li>

    <li><p> Neither you nor Crucial will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p></li>

    <li><p> If the class action waiver set forth herein, or any other provision of this Section 15, is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some aspects of a dispute, then that section will not apply to those aspects. Instead, those aspects will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining aspects proceeding in arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 17 will remain in full force and effect.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Third-Party Links.</b>  The Crucial Service may present links to third-party Web sites or third-party services not owned or operated by us. We are not responsible for the availability of these third-party sites or services or their contents.
